I started my new journey after quitting my job in March 2023. I have decided to work solo from now on. With a background in backend development and blockchain, I rarely work on frontend as my team usually takes care of that. I have tried various frameworks, including Vue and Svelte, but eventually, I ended up using TinaCMS and NextJS. This decision came after watching a YouTube video where the presenter suggested that NextJS was his top choice (along with SolidJS); I had no prior knowledge of either framework. When searching for a headless CMS, Google recommended Frontmatter and TinaCMS. Since TinaCMS can be used with NextJS, I decided to go with it.
